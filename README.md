## Shards of Time

A top-down, pixel-art roguelike RPG where time is shattered into shifting "shards." Explore procedural biomes, fight tactical turn-based battles, and return to a hub village that remembers. Collect time fragments to rebuild what was lostâ€”and decide whether to break the cycle or master it.

### Features
- Procedural runs with events, shops, and bosses
- Turn-based tactical combat with statuses, terrain, and synergies
- Exponential difficulty and optional corruption modifiers
- Meta progression: classes, relics, hub upgrades, and story memory

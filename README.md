## Mazerunner

A top-down, pixel-art maze exploration game where you navigate through procedurally generated mazes, collect items, and avoid dangerous enemies. Use your immunity power-ups strategically to clear paths and reach the exit before your health runs out.

### Gameplay
Navigate through increasingly complex mazes using WASD or arrow keys. Collect yellow blobs to increase your score (required to complete each level), while avoiding or strategically eliminating enemies. Use health blobs to restore lost health, immunity blobs to temporarily become invincible and kill enemies, and speed boost orbs for faster movement. Grey orbs are special collectibles stored in your inventory.

## Gameplay Loop (First Run Focus)

### First 30–60 Minutes
1. Wake in the Last Village (hub) with minimal facilities.
2. Choose starting class (Warrior/Mage/Rogue).
3. Enter Withered Forest shard.
4. Encounter rotation: 2 combats → event → shop/rest → elite → combat → boss.
5. Claim first time shard; unlock Smith or Library back at hub.

### Encounter Types
- Combat: standard or elite with modifiers.
- Event: choices with risk/reward outcomes.
- Merchant: purchase gear/relics; limited rerolls.
- Rest: heal, clear a debuff, or upgrade a skill.

### Boss Flow
- Two-phase mechanics; second phase introduces biome twist (e.g., spreading poison roots).
- Rewards: time shard + relic + ability upgrade option.

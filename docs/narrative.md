Time shattered in a divine war. The world loops; only a few remember. You are a Warden piecing together shards to confront the source of the fracture.

- NPC memory improves as the hub grows; dialogue branches unlock.
- Vision events reveal past cycles and choices.

### Arcs
- Rebuild the Last Village (hub) by rescuing specialists.
- Unmask the Guardians as fallen echoes bound by regrets.
- Final choice: end the cycle or ascend as its keeper.
